# ESP32 Amp Channel Switcher

A sophisticated ESP32-based amplifier channel switcher with wireless control, MIDI support, and comprehensive logging capabilities. Supports multiple amp configurations through build-time configuration.

## Features

- **Multi-Channel Amp Switching**: Support for 2-4 amplifier channels via relays
- **Build-Time Configuration**: All pin assignments, device name, and channel count are set via `platformio.ini` and parsed at runtime
- **Runtime Pin Reporting**: Use the `pins` serial command to display all current pin assignments (amp switch, button, LED, MIDI)
- **Wireless Control**: ESP-NOW communication for wireless remote control
- **MIDI Support**: Program change messages for channel switching
- **OTA Updates**: Over-the-air firmware updates
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Multi-level logging with timestamps and NVS persistence
- **Serial Commands**: Extensive command interface for debugging and control
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance and memory tracking
- **Auto-Pairing**: Automatic device pairing system
- **Button Support**: Physical buttons for direct channel switching
- **LED Feedback Patterns**: Status LED provides feedback for events (data, command, MIDI, OTA, error, pairing)

## Build-Time Configuration System

All hardware pin assignments, feature flags, and channel counts are now set in `config.h` or via build flags in `platformio.ini`. The `CLIENT_TYPE` macro determines the device's role and features at build time. At runtime, the firmware parses these macros and reports the actual configuration via the `config` and `pins` serial commands.

### How CLIENT_TYPE Works
- Each build environment in `platformio.ini` sets a `CLIENT_TYPE` (e.g., `AMP_SWITCHER`)
- Other flags (e.g., `MAX_AMPSWITCHS`, `AMP_SWITCH_PINS`, `DEVICE_NAME`) are set per environment
- The firmware adapts its features, pins, and commands based on these flags

#### Example: Adding a New Client Type
To add a new device type or configuration:
1. Add a new environment in `platformio.ini`:
```ini
[env:client-custom-amp]
extends = env:esp32-c3-devkitc-02
build_flags = 
    -D CLIENT_TYPE=AMP_SWITCHER
    -D MAX_AMPSWITCHS=3
    -D AMP_SWITCH_PINS="4,5,6"
    -D AMP_BUTTON_PINS="8,9,10"
    -D DEVICE_NAME="CUSTOM_AMP"
```
2. Build with the new configuration:
```bash
platformio run -e client-custom-amp
```

### Viewing the Current Configuration
- Use the `config` serial command to display the current build configuration, including client type, pins, and device name.
- Use the `pins` serial command to display all runtime pin assignments (amp switch, button, LED, MIDI).

## Hardware Setup

### Pin Configuration
- **Amp Switch Pins**: Set via `AMP_SWITCH_PINS` in `platformio.ini` (e.g., GPIO 2, 3, 4, 5)
- **Amp Button Pins**: Set via `AMP_BUTTON_PINS` in `platformio.ini` (e.g., GPIO 8, 9, 10, 20)
- **Status/Pairing LED**: Set via `PAIRING_LED_PIN` (default: GPIO 1, reserved for LED only)
- **MIDI RX**: Set via `MIDI_RX_PIN` (default: GPIO 6)
- **MIDI TX**: Set via `MIDI_TX_PIN` (default: GPIO 7)

> **Note:** GPIO 1 is reserved for the status/pairing LED. Do **not** use GPIO 1 for relays or switches to avoid conflicts.

**Button 1 (amp channel 1 button) now has multiple functions:**
- **Short press (<5s):** Switch to channel 1
- **Long press (>5s):** Enter pairing mode (after setup window)
- **Long press during setup (hold for 5s within first 10s after boot):** Enter OTA mode

> **Note:** There is no longer a dedicated OTA button. OTA mode can only be triggered by serial command (`ota`) or by holding Button 1 for 5 seconds during the setup window after boot.

### Supported Configurations

| Configuration | Channels | Switch Pins | Button Pins | Device Name |
|---------------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `client-2ch-amp` | 2 | 4, 5 | 8, 9 | 2CH_AMP |
| `client-4ch-amp` | 4 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 8, 9, 10, 20 | 4CH_AMP |
| `client-amp-switcher` | 4 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 8, 9, 10, 20 | AMP_SWITCHER_1 |

> **Note:** GPIO 20 is used for the 4th amp button on the ESP32-C3 Super Mini. GPIO 11 is not available on this board.

## NVS Storage Versioning

All persistent settings (pairing info, log level, MIDI mapping) are stored in NVS (non-volatile storage) with a version number (`STORAGE_VERSION`).
- On firmware upgrade, if the stored version does not match the current firmware's `STORAGE_VERSION`, the affected settings are reset to safe defaults and the new version is saved.
- This ensures safe upgrades and prevents configuration corruption if the data structure changes.
- You can safely update firmware or change configuration without risking old/bad data being loaded.

**NVS versioned settings include:**
- Pairing info
- Log level
- MIDI Program Change mapping

If you see a warning about an NVS version mismatch, the device has reset that setting to defaults for safety.

## Troubleshooting

- **Pins or config command does not match your expected configuration:**  
  Check your `platformio.ini` build flags and rebuild the firmware. All configuration is dynamic and reported at runtime.
- **MIDI Learn does not work:**  
  Ensure you are holding both Button 1 and Button 2 for >2s, then releasing and pressing the desired channel button, and then sending a MIDI Program Change. Use `midimap` to verify the current mapping.
- **No serial output:**  
  Check your serial monitor baud rate (115200), verify your USB connection, and try a different USB cable if needed.
- **Pairing issues:**  
  Use the `pair` command to reset pairing. Check WiFi channel compatibility and ensure both devices are in pairing mode.
- **OTA not working:**  
  Enter OTA mode by holding Button 1 for 5s during the setup window after boot, or by sending the `ota` serial command.
- **Memory issues:**  
  Use `debugmemory` to check memory usage. Monitor for memory leaks and consider reducing log level if needed.
- **MIDI not working:**  
  Check MIDI cable connections, verify MIDI channel settings, and test with the `midi` command.
- **Log level or debug output missing:**  
  Use `setlog4` to enable all logs, or `loglevel` to check the current log level.
- **NVS version mismatch warning:**  
  The device has reset that setting to defaults for safety. This is normal after a firmware upgrade or config structure change.

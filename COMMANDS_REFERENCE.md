# ESP32 Amp Switcher - Quick Command Reference

> **Note:** The available commands, channel numbers, and button numbers depend on the build-time configuration (e.g., CLIENT_TYPE, MAX_AMPSWITCHS, pin assignments) set in platformio.ini and config.h.

## MIDI Learn Feature
- **To enter MIDI Learn mode:** Hold Button 1 and Button 2 together for >2 seconds. The device will indicate MIDI Learn mode is armed (LED/serial).
- **To select a channel:** Release both, then short-press the desired channel button (b1â€“b4). The device will wait for a MIDI Program Change message.
- **To assign:** Send a MIDI Program Change from your controller. The received PC number will be mapped to the selected channel and saved to NVS.
- **To view mapping:** Use the `midimap` serial command.
- **Mapping is persistent** and can be changed at any time using the above process.

### Troubleshooting
- If MIDI Learn does not work, ensure you are holding both Button 1 and Button 2 for >2s, then pressing the desired channel button, and then sending a MIDI Program Change.
- Use `midimap` to verify the current mapping.

## Debug Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `debugperf` | Show performance metrics |
| `debugmemory` | Show memory analysis |
| `debugwifi` | Show WiFi statistics |
| `debugespnow` | Show ESP-NOW statistics |
| `debugtask` | Show task statistics |

## Testing Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `testled` | Test status LED |
| `testpairing` | Test pairing LED |

## Control Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ota` | Enter OTA update mode (serial command, or hold Button 1 for 5s during setup) |
| `pair` | Clear pairing and re-pair |
| `clearall` | Clear all NVS data (pairing + log level) |

## Configuration Support & Pin Assignments

- All pin assignments, device name, and channel count are set via `platformio.ini` and parsed at runtime. The `config` and `pins` commands always show the actual runtime configuration.
- **MIDI RX/TX pins** are now reported in the `pins` command.

**4-Channel Example (default):**
- **Relay (Switch) Pins:** 2, 3, 4, 5
- **Button Pins:** 8, 9, 10, 20
- **Status/Pairing LED:** 1 (reserved for LED only)
- **MIDI RX/TX:** 6, 7

> **Note:** GPIO 1 is reserved for the status/pairing LED. Do **not** use GPIO 1 for relays or switches.
> **Note:** GPIO 20 is used for the 4th amp button on the ESP32-C3 Super Mini. GPIO 11 is not available on this board.

Use the `config` or `pins` command to see your current build configuration and pin assignments.

## LED Feedback Patterns
- **Single Flash:** ESP-NOW data received
- **Double Flash:** Serial command or ESP-NOW command received
- **Triple Flash:** MIDI message received
- **Fast Blink:** OTA update in progress
- **Solid On:** Error state
- **Fade/Breath:** Pairing mode

## Common Usage Examples

```bash
# Set logging to show info and above
setlog3

# Check system status
status

# Check current configuration
config

# Show all pin assignments
pins

# Switch to channel 2
2

# Show debug info
debug

# Test LED
testled

# Clear all settings
clearall

# Restart device
restart
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

1. **No response from device**: Try `restart`
2. **Can't see logs**: Try `setlog4`
3. **Memory issues**: Use `debugmemory`
4. **WiFi problems**: Use `debugwifi`
5. **Pairing issues**: Use `pair` then check `debugespnow`
6. **Wrong configuration**: Use `config` or `pins` to verify current configuration and pin assignments
7. **Reset everything**: Use `clearall` to reset all settings

## Log Levels Explained

- **0 (OFF)**: No output
- **1 (ERROR)**: Only critical errors
- **2 (WARN)**: Warnings and errors
- **3 (INFO)**: Normal operation info
- **4 (DEBUG)**: Detailed debug info

## Performance Monitoring

Use these commands to monitor system health:

```bash
# Check overall performance
debugperf

# Monitor memory usage
debugmemory

# Check WiFi performance
debugwifi

# Monitor ESP-NOW status
debugespnow

# Check current configuration
config
```

## Button 1 Multi-Function Summary

| Action | When | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| Short press (<5s) | Any time | Switch to channel 1 |
| Long press (>5s) | After setup window | Enter pairing mode |
| Long press (>5s) | During setup window (first 10s after boot) | Enter OTA mode |

## NVS Storage Versioning

All persistent settings (pairing info, log level, MIDI mapping) are stored in NVS (non-volatile storage) with a version number (`STORAGE_VERSION`).
- On firmware upgrade, if the stored version does not match the current firmware's `STORAGE_VERSION`, the affected settings are reset to safe defaults and the new version is saved.
- This ensures safe upgrades and prevents configuration corruption if the data structure changes.
- You can safely update firmware or change configuration without risking old/bad data being loaded.

**NVS versioned settings include:**
- Pairing info
- Log level
- MIDI Program Change mapping

If you see a warning about an NVS version mismatch, the device has reset that setting to defaults for safety.
